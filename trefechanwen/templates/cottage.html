            <b>Discounts available:</b> A discount of &pound;50 will be applied for parties
            of 1 or 2 people OR returning guests will be allowed a 10% reduction.

            summer holidays. The minimum stay is for three nights; please contact us for

            <br><br>
            <b>Payment:</b> Bookings are to be accompanied by a deposit of one third of the
            rent. The balance of the rent must be paid 56 days (8 weeks) before the

            handling charge of &pound;25.00. If we are unable to re&ndash;let all monies

            date with flea and worming treatments and owners are responsible for cleaning up
            any mess. Dogs must not be left alone in the property at any time.
            <br><br>

        <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text mdl-card--expand">
            <b>Exposure:</b> The cottage sits in a courtyard of former farm buildings. The
            rear garden backs onto an open field.
            <br><br>
            <b>Transport + Parking:</b> The site is within a mile of Goodwick town (shop,
            post office, pharmacy and railway station). There is level vehicular access
            and parking right to the front door.
            <br><br>
            <b>Front entrance door</b> is reached across a level block-paved path and two
            block steps. It is 90cm wide with manual, colour-contrasted door handle at 125cm
            height and outside light.
            <br><br>
            <b>Rear entrance door</b> is reached across a level block-paved path and one
            block step. It is 80cm wide with manual, colour-contrasted door handle at 125cm
            height and outside light.
            <br><br>
            <b>All rooms</b> &mdash; apart from the crog&ndash;loft bedroom 1 &mdash; are
            on ground&ndash;floor level with no steps or slopes and with inward&ndash;opening
            doors 80cm wide.
            <br><br>
            <b>Kitchen</b> surfaces and power points are at traditional cabinet height as is
            the cooking hob. Two double power points at 15cm above floor level.
            <br><br>
            <b>Bathroom</b> has a wheelchair accessible toilet without support rails. Shower
            is over a standard bath and is not accessible by wheelchair.
            <br><br>
            <b>Bedroom 2</b> is wheelchair accessible and furniture can be rearranged (e.g.
            twin beds pushed together as double bed) on prior request.
            <br><br>
            <b>Crog&ndash;loft bedroom 1</b> has limited headroom and is accessed via a
            narrow 11&ndash;stepped spiral staircase which may prove problematic to guests
            of limited mobility.
            <br><br>
            <b>Rear garden</b> has level block&ndash;paved path and generally level seating
            area. Gravel paths run round either side to the front of the cottage. Grassy area
            has gentle slopes within the boundary banks.
            <br><br>
            <b>Cottage information</b> includes user instructions for appliances provided and
            details of local facilities and destinations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Miscellaneous:</b> Owners live on site. Postcode is SA64 0HS but SatNav is
            likely to take you past the premises. There are the ruins of a Welsh Longhouse
            adjacent to the front courtyard so care is needed with children. The drive from
            the road is shared with owners and their neighbours. Mobile phone signal is
            generally good; internet hub details are provided. Electricity and water are
            mains&ndash;supplied; cooking is by electricity; heating by oil boiler and log
            burner.
