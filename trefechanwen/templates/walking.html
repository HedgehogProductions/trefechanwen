                the Coast Path. OS maps OL35 and OL36 are useful.

                as a base to start the Coast Path, from Cardigan, which has worked very well. The walk was glorious,
                    fantastic scenery and colonies of seals”</i>

                is Britain’s only coastal National Park and was established in 1952.  The National Park website has
                a wealth of information including lots of walks that are not part of the Coast Path.  We have
                printed a selection of these walks for our guests &mdash; including some ‘walks from the door’.

                over many years of North Pembs holidays. The charm is that change has been minimal, long may it be
                    so.”</i>

                The Daugleddau Estuary</a>
                is the coming together of four rivers; East and West Cleddau, Carew and Creswell. It is a magical
                place good for walking and wildlife watching. It tends to be overlooked by visitors to Pembrokeshire
                so is often very peaceful and quiet. Discover Carew Castle, Lawrenny Quay or walk part of the
                Landsker Border Trail, all very different to the coastal scenery.

                The Preseli Hills</a>
                provide another contrast to Pembrokeshire’s famous coast. This is a landscape of wild moorland,
                heath and grasslands. On a clear day the views are panoramic, taking in Snowdonia, the Gower and
                Ireland. Paths here are ancient &mdash; follow in our ancestors’ footsteps.
